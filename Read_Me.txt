This project showcases the deployment of an AI model on an STM32 microcontroller using the X-CUBE-AI tool.

The Project :
Design and train a classification AI model on a PC using Python and TensorFlow.
Optimize and convert the model to STM32 compatibility with X-CUBE-AI.
Implement the model on an STM32 board to perform the model.
Evaluate and compare the performance metrics (accuracy, execution time, and resource utilization) between the STM32 and the PC.
Requirements :
Stm32f407 or any other stm32 board
StmcubeIDE 
StmCubeMX
X-Cube-AI
