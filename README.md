# TinyML Movement Prediction with STM32F407  

This project demonstrates the use of TinyML to predict movements based on accelerometer data from an STM32F407 microcontroller. The system uses a trained AI model to classify movements (forward, backward, right, left, or stable) and triggers corresponding LEDs to indicate the detected motion.
